### 'What is this ?'


This was a WebGL browser-client clone of a 1980's DOS game called Spacewar.  Now it's a superset of that.


##### It's also:

-  a networking infrastructure (like could be used for chat/gaming, or other) built around nodejs websocket endpoints with access to microservices over sockets also.  redis4, rust, haskell ?  a simple pure-fp state machine (flux?) state mgmt for the nodejs process.

- browser-clients built with webpack, react layer, webgl game layer, webrtc, webworker multithreading,

- a research & development platform / laboratory for myself : networking, simulation/ai, UIs, etc.
