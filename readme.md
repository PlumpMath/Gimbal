#### history:



**this project started when:**
_from before_
>I wanted to learn WebGL and create a 2d game first, before building a lightweight 3d engine roll from scratch (possibly then moving to an open source project) to learn.  The focus here isn't on the game itself; the platform is intended to have general applicability over the problem space. Excellence in networking, sensor aggregation, AI, and informatically-rich UIs are common requirements.

That was/is Spacewar, doing a proto for WebGL and some other stuff (WebWorkers, WebRTC).  Now I'm refactoring the wholly fawk out of it and turning it into a fully networked conglomeration with all kinds of extensibility, from WebRTC to Rust microservices, giving chances to learn each in turn while simultaneously establishing POC and a working pattern.

As an amateur aerospace maven, ultimately my goal was/is to do a kind of Falcon Version 23.0, a hackers' paradise of a flight simulator, updated with 2018 hardware and software to max it. Linux open-source.  Nodejs, Rust, React, WebGL, later desktop clients.  Accomplishing this leads to something deeper with great generality of applicability.  

Physical systems simulation, the computation of counterfactuals to the correctness of the fully referential models.  The simulation of machinic, social, etc systems within physical systems.  This is the forgotten pole, counterpoint, and corollary to the much more publicized revolution in AI (machine learning, deep learning, neural nets, machine vision, etc).  In a scenario universe where biological intelligence continues to reign over machinic (on plausible lines that Penrose was indeed on to something in Emperor's New Mind &c), the sensor aggregation to situational awareness interface is fulcrum (as centrally important as AI tools); and even in a scenario where AI supercedes vastly, simulation remains the AIs' best tool (I presume..?) for extrapolation/inquiry in counterfactuals. More directly, I'm asserting the importance of (A) simulation (physical, machinic, social, whatever as long as it's made referentially rigourous), and (B) sensor-aggregation/situational-awareness-interface, as well as stating that these are the central concerns of this project, and more prosaically, of flight-sims as software artifacts.  Commercially, these tools/techniques have application to game-server systems and any shopping or social-media contraption the next disruptors/startup founder cares to bring to the table.




**\***Arguably, simulation is a superset of AI, in the sense of AI being 'simulated' intelligence. To the extent that the simulated intelligence is considered real and is indeed useful in practical applications (in a way that simulated physical reality isn't/ can't be substituted into a real physical system in that way), not so much.  But the constructive simulative approach is similar from a modeling approach to the problem aspect anyway.
