#### rust clients

It occurred to me that if we can connect rust microservices over websockets, we might as well also connect rust clients, that are analogous in function to the browser-clients, but are of course desktop native apps.  This would be to implement something like Falcon 4.0 network gaming, with fully optimised desktop programs instead of in the browser.
