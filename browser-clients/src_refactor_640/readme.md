### refactor 640


Branch 'horizontally', in the sense of adding in the refactor/dev branch structure on the same commit line, with the files co-existing for awhile in order to have access to both.

##### So...

Can treat this as basically an src folder and start from scratch, then can just swap out en-masse at the time.



#### Design Considerations

- React overlay for GUI stuff.

- audio


- better separation of state calculation from side-effects.
